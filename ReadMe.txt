This project involves developing a spam detector that predicts whether an email is spam based on a specific dataset. To achieve this, 
I utilized a Random Forest Classifier along with several key steps in the data processing pipeline.
The process includes data preprocessing to clean and prepare the email data for analysis, followed by vectorization to convert the
text data into a numerical format suitable for model training. After training the model, I evaluated its accuracy using various metrics
and used it to predict whether a given email is spam or not.

Preprocessing: Removing all of the "\r\n", making the whole text lower case,
removing all the punctuasion, stemming process 

main.py is the first attempt while Secondary.py is the finished code program
